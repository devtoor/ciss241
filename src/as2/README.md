# Cat Snake - Graphics and Animation

Correctly complete the following assignment. Follow all directions.  Make sure to use `Graphics2D` objects and the animation steps required. Use the `setSize()` method to resize the applet in the applet viewer. The final `.java` file and a picture of the output applet viewer with the applet running should be submitted. A picture of the applet viewer can be taken by holding down the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and pressing the <kbd>Prtscr</kbd> key (will take a picture of the active window and save onto the clipboard). The picture can be pasted into Paint, saved as a `.jpg` file, and submitted. 

Hint:

Good guides: ex1511 on gradient paint, ex152b on general path, ex142 on paint animation.
