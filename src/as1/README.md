# Yankees File Streams

Correctly complete the following assignment. Follow all directions here and in the separate instructions file `yanksfilejol.md`. The final program `.java` file and the separate output `.txt` text file    `yankees.txt` should be submitted.  The input file `yankees.yanks` is attached, it should be copied into the project folder. The class definition file `yankees.java` is attached, it should be copied into the package `files13` (without a separate src folder). The `yankees.yanks` file was made in a project with a `files13` package without a separate src folder, so you will want to make sure that is your setup. Make sure you keep the yankees.java file as it is since that is how the `yankees.yanks` file was created. If you do accidentally change the `yankees.java` file the original serial ID number is included as a data field. Make sure you read entire objects and only output individual characters one by one with `write()` to produce a plain ASCII character file.  You can open the output `yankees.txt` file in Eclipse to check (if you open in Notepad, Notepad doesn't read the '\n' new line character but you can `write()` the '\r' return character, but I will open in Eclipse so either one will work in Eclipse).  Any questions, let me know.  Good Luck. 

Hint: 

Good guides: ex132b on writing an individual character, ex136 on reading objects.
