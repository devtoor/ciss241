13-4

Use the attached input file of a list of Fahrenheit temperatures for a series of days. Read these amounts (however many there may be), calculate the equivalent Celsius temperature, and write the labeled results to an output file in this form (91 Fahrenheit = 32.778 Celsius) with fahrenheit as a whole number and celsius to three decimal places on one line each. Use File I/O as Console I/O - Scanner connected to an input file and PrintWriter connected to an output file, instead of our usual Scanner sc object connected to the keyboard and the predefined `System.out` object connected to the monitor.  Have the user input the names of the input and output files.
