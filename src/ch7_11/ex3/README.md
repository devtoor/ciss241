Update the smiley face applet.  Originally it had a button that by clicking on a button, the smiley face would alternate between a frown and a smile.  Add another button to let the smiley face wink and then not wink.  To draw a wink, lessen the height on one of the eyes. This was originally exercise 10-11.

Add a test in actionPerformed to see what button the user clicked on.  In paint(), add another if test if the user wants a wink (or to end a wink).  If they do, draw one of the eyes as an arc instead of an oval (so it looks like the eye is not fully open).  The arc would be the same width and height as if it was the full oval.
