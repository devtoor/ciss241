Exercise JDBC - ODBC Bridge - Access

If you have Access and the ODBC Data Source (or download from easysoft.com), use the following steps to set up the bridge from the Access ODBC to Java JDBC.

1. Open Access
2. Create the database file
3. Close the database file
4. Control Panel
5. Icons - Administrative Tools (or System and Security - Administrative Tools)
6. Data Sources - ODBC
7. Add - Microsoft Access Database
8. Data Source Name
9. Database - Select - find database file
10. Ok - Ok

Then go into Eclipse, enter the program, and then compile & execute it. It will execute as usual. You can then either print the results on the screen in the java program or go into Access, open your database file, and see the new table and results.
