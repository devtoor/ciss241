20-2

Create 2 queries for the yankees table from the baseball Access database or Derby database.  It will be set up similar to 20-1, then add the query and `ResultSet`.  You can combine both into one java program using either 1 - Access or 2 - Derby.  Give the proper query statement and display the results. 


a. The first will be to list the players name, number, and position (in that order) for all players whose number is less than 20 (of course most of the low numbers have been retired because of all the great players in the history of the Yankees).  Sort the list by position.


b. The second will be to ask the user what position they want to see listed, then list the name and number for all players at that position.
