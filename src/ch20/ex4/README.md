Write a java program to connect to the yankees access database file. After connecting to the file, write a java 
statement (using SQL) to add a record for yourself - use your name, position of LF, and number 0. Then write a java statement to change your record, so your position is changed from LF to 1B. Now write a java statement to list the records (onto the screen) that have position of 1B (you) or SS (Derek Jeter), by listing the `pos` field, `num` field, and `name` field (in that order) for the two records that match your criteria.
