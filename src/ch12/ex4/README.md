Add a try block and at least 6 catch blocks with a specific error message for each type of exception to the following attached program.  You can use one try block and separate catch blocks so the error messages will tell exactly what wen wrong. Then run the program and try to make the different types of errors. 

1. User doesn't input an int for howmany numbers 
2. User doesn't input an int for number in dialog box 
3. You can't print with printf (also fix in code so you can run the rest)
4. User trys to input too many ints into the array
5. User inputs a zero for number in dialog box (because of division, check for a zero yourself, then create and throw an arithmetic exception) 
6. For anything else, add a super Exception catch
