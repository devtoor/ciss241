12-3

Create a program that will input a number grade from a user in a dialog box (you can base it off of lab exercise 12-2).  Input it as a string, try to convert it to an integer, and try to see if the number is valid (between 0 & 100, otherwise you would consider it an Exception).  Give separate specific catch block error messages for each type of possible exception, plus include the message and stack trace (you can output to the console, the output doesn't have to be in a dialog box).  For the invalid input (not between 0 and 100), you will have to use an if test and throw the exception yourself (since java wouldn't consider that an exception). 

Attach the completed .java file for ex123.java and submit.
