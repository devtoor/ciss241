Using your own layouts with `setBounds()`, design the attached lycos search page. Plan out the coordinates for the placement and sizes of the two checkboxes, textfield, button, and image. You do not have to supply the event handlers for clicking or typing. The image is also attached. Lycos (with their image periodically changing) can be found at [www.lycos.com](http://www.lycos.com/) . Submit your code.

Hint: It works best when you draw the image in a regular `paint()` method (after running the super `JApplet` `paint()` method).  Also, checkboxes have a background around them so you may need to set the checkboxes background to the container's background.
